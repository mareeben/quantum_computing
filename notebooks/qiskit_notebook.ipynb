    "# **Introduction**\n",
    "This notebook explores using the IBM quantum computer library, Qiskit. Qiskit supports running code against one of three Quantum Computers that are available to the  public. It also supports local simulation of quantum circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main implementation in this notebook is Shor's algorithm. An algorithm for determining the prime factors of an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **IBM’s Quantum Computers**\n",
    "IBM’s quantum computing platform and tools, such as Qiskit, play a crucial role in making quantum mechanics accessible to developers and researchers.\n",
    "1. **Qiskit Framework:**\n",
    "    - Qiskit is IBM's python-based open-source SDK, enabling developers to interface with quantum computers and simulators.\n",
    "    - It allows users to build quantum circuits, execute them locally in simulators, or connect to real quantum hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cloud-Based Quantum Access:**\n",
    "    - IBM Quantum offers access to their quantum computers through a cloud-based platform. This makes it possible for users anywhere in the world to experiment with quantum computing without requiring their own quantum hardware.\n",
    "    - IBM provides various backends, including simulators and actual quantum processors, for running computations through APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How Quantum Computers Work:**\n",
    "    - **Qubits:** Unlike classical bits, which exist as 0s or 1s, qubits leverage the principles of superposition and can represent a combination of both states simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to explore multiple possibilities in parallel.\n",
    "    - **Entanglement:** Qubits can become entangled, meaning the state of one qubit is directly related to the state of another, even if they are physically distant. This property enables coordinated computations across qubits.\n",
    "    - **Interference:** Quantum computers take advantage of interference to amplify correct solutions and cancel incorrect ones, improving computation efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Noisy Quantum Systems:**\n",
    "    - IBM’s quantum computers are currently limited by noise and hardware constraints. Errors can arise due to qubit decoherence and gate inaccuracies. Thus, algorithms running on these devices may require multiple attempts or error correction techniques.\n",
    "    - Despite limitations, IBM quantum computers are powerful tools for researching quantum algorithms and applications, such as Shor’s algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **IBM's Contribution to Accessibility and Innovation:**\n",
    "    - By offering free compute time and robust tools for developers (like 10 free minutes per month), IBM is democratizing quantum research, fostering innovation among the computing community.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **How Quantum Algorithms Work**\n",
    "Quantum algorithms leverage quantum mechanical principles to perform computations that are difficult or infeasible for classical computers. Here’s an outline of how they operate and their unique characteristics:\n",
    "1. **Superposition:**\n",
    "    - Quantum algorithms place qubits into a superposition of states, effectively enabling the exploration of many computational paths simultaneously.\n",
    "    - For example, in Shor's algorithm, superposition is used to simultaneously evaluate the phase of exponents during period finding.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interference:**\n",
    "    - Constructive and destructive interference are used to amplify correct solutions and suppress incorrect ones. This property is key to achieving speed and accuracy in quantum computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Entanglement:**\n",
    "    - Quantum algorithms often utilize entanglement to link qubits and maintain correlations across computations. This feature is used in Shor's algorithm during quantum phase estimation (QPE) to extract correlations between measurement outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Steps of Quantum Algorithms in Shor's Algorithm:**\n",
    "    - **Classical Pre-Processing:** Shor’s algorithm first uses classical computation to select the random number `a` and verify it is coprime with the input `N`.\n",
    "    - **Quantum Period Finding:** This step uses a quantum circuit to determine the periodicity `r` of the function `a^x mod N` using quantum phase estimation. The quantum speedup occurs here as the quantum system efficiently determines the period using a superposition of states.\n",
    "    - **Classical Post-Processing:** Once the period `r` is determined, classical computation resumes to compute `gcd` values and deduce the factors of `N`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Why Quantum Algorithms Are Powerful:**\n",
    "    - Quantum systems can compute results probabilistically by collapsing quantum states through measurements. Through repeated iterations, quantum algorithms reinforce the probability of correct results, overcoming inaccuracies due to noise or hardware constraints.\n",
    "    - Algorithms like Shor’s represent the potential for quantum computers to revolutionize fields like cryptography, optimization, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Importance of Shor’s Algorithm**\n",
    "Shor's algorithm is one of the most celebrated quantum algorithms because it directly challenges the security foundations of modern cryptography. Its importance lies in its ability to efficiently factor large integers, a problem upon which the security of widely used cryptographic systems like RSA is based.\n",
    "1. **RSA and Cryptography Dependence on Prime Factorization:**\n",
    "    - Classical encryption systems like RSA use the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers as a security backbone. This is because no efficient classical algorithm exists for factoring these large numbers.\n",
    "    - Shor's algorithm, when implemented on a sufficiently large and error-free quantum computer, can solve this problem exponentially faster than any classical algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exponential Speed-up:**\n",
    "    - Classical algorithms for factoring integers, like the General Number Field Sieve (GNFS), require exponential time as the size of the number increases. Shor's algorithm, using quantum computation, reduces this to polynomial time, making it vastly more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Impact on Cybersecurity:**\n",
    "    - If sufficiently powerful (and stable) quantum computers are developed, they could break the RSA encryption, rendering it obsolete. This has pushed researchers to explore post-quantum cryptographic systems that are resistant to attacks from quantum algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scientific Milestone:**\n",
    "    - Beyond its cryptographic implications, Shor's algorithm also serves as a benchmark for quantum computing, helping demonstrate the potential and superiority of quantum systems for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Shor's Algorithm\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Factorizing a number, $N,$ is an important problem in cryptography. Classical public-key cryptography systems,\n",
    "such as RSA, rely on the fact that factoring large integers ($N$) into their prime components ($p$ and $q$\n",
    "such that $N = p * q$) is computationally hard for classical systems. Shor's algorithm, when implemented\n",
    "on a quantum computer, provides an efficient solution to this problem, threatening classical cryptographic\n",
    "security measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Steps\n",
    "Shor's algorithm works in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Classical Pre-Processing - choosing a suitable value of $a$**\n",
    "- We want to pick a random integer $a$ such that $1 < a < N$ and $gcd(a, N) = 1$ (i.e., $a$ is coprime with $N$).\n",
    "- This step can be done classically and requires us to use the greatest common divisor (gcd) function to verify co-primality.\n",
    "- If $\\textrm{gcd}(a, N) \\neq 1$, then $N$ is not a prime number and we already have a factor of $N$ (this step makes the algorithm probabilistic).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Quantum period finding - estimation of the period $r$**\n",
    "- Using quantum computation, this step determines the period $r$ of the modular exponentiation function: $a^x mod N$.\n",
    "- The function $a^x \\textrm{mod} N$ is periodic because, for an integer period $r$, we have:\n",
    "      $a^(x + r) \\textrm{mod} N = a^x \\textrm{mod} N$\n",
    "- Quantum phase estimation is central to this step because it leverages the superposition of quantum states to find the period efficiently.\n",
    "- If this step is run without a quantum computer, it would take exponential time, which is infeasible for large $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Classical Post-Processing - use the period $r$ to factorize N**\n",
    "- Once we compute the period $r$, we proceed as follows:\n",
    "    - If r is odd or if $a^{r/2} \\equiv 1 (\\textrm{mod} N)$, we cannot reliably factorize $N$, and we may need to try a new value of $a$.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, compute the factors of N using:\n",
    "        factors = $\\textrm{gcd}(a^{r/2} - 1, N)$ and $\\textrm{gcd}(a^{r/2} + 1, N)$\n",
    "    - One or both of these gcd calculations will yield a factor of N with high probability.\n",
    "- Mathematically, this step works because the properties of modular arithmetic link the period $r$ to the factors of $N.$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Considerations\n",
    "**Why is Shor's algorithm probabilistic?**\n",
    "- The success of Shor's algorithm depends on the selection of $a$. If a chosen $a$ does not provide a useful period $r$,\n",
    "  we must retry with a new value of $a$. This makes the algorithm probabilistic.\n",
    "- Additionally, quantum computers produce results probabilistically due to the nature of quantum measurements.\n",
    "  This means that we might have to run the quantum computation multiple times to increase the confidence in the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dependence on quantum computers:**\n",
    "- The critical Step 2 would take exponential time on a classical computer since determining the period $r$ using\n",
    "  modular exponentiation grows exponentially with the size of N.\n",
    "- Quantum computers, however, leverage superposition and interference to solve the period-finding problem efficiently,\n",
    "  making them exponentially faster than classical computers for this specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations on the size of integers we can factorize:**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are sizeable limitations on what we can factorize. At present only small numbers, like $N=15$ can be factorized (as of 2025, the largest integer that has been factorized is 21, on a compiled, optimized, version of Shor's algorithm). Some of the largest constraints arise from Gate Limitations -\n",
    "- **Fidelity Issues:**\n",
    "  Quantum gates are not perfect; real implementations introduce errors due to noise and hardware imperfections, especially for two-qubit gates (e.g., CNOT).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decoherence:**\n",
    "  Qubits lose their quantum state over time due to interactions with the environment, limiting the number of sequential gates (circuit depth) that can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gate Speed:**\n",
    "  Gates take time to execute, and slower gates increase the risk of decoherence during computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Connectivity Constraints:**\n",
    "  Not all qubits can interact directly, requiring additional **SWAP gates** to enable operations between qubits, which adds overhead and noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Circuit Scaling Challenges:**\n",
    "  Current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have limited qubits and cannot perform error correction efficiently, constraining the complexity of algorithms that can be successful."
