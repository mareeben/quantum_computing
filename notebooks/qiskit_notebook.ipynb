    "# Shor's Algorithm\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Factorizing N is an important problem in cryptography. Classical public-key cryptography systems,\n",
    "such as RSA, rely on the fact that factoring large integers (N) into their prime components (p and q\n",
    "such that $N = p * q$) is computationally hard for classical systems. Shor's algorithm, when implemented\n",
    "on a quantum computer, provides an efficient solution to this problem, threatening classical cryptographic\n",
    "security measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Steps\n",
    "Shor's algorithm works in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Choose a suitable value of $a$\n",
    "- We want to pick a random integer $a$ such that $1 < a < N$ and $gcd(a, N) = 1$ (i.e., $a$ is coprime with $N$).\n",
    "- This step can be done classically and requires us to use the greatest common divisor (gcd) function to verify co-primality.\n",
    "- If $\\textrm{gcd}(a, N) \\neq 1$, then $N$ is not a prime number and we already have a factor of $N$ (this step makes the algorithm probabilistic).\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Quantum phase estimation to find the period $r$\n",
    "- Using quantum computation, this step determines the period $r$ of the modular exponentiation function: $a^x mod N$.\n",
    "- The function $a^x \\textrm{mod} N$ is periodic because, for an integer period $r$, we have:\n",
    "      $a^(x + r) \\textrm{mod} N = a^x \\textrm{mod} N$\n",
    "- Quantum phase estimation is central to this step because it leverages the superposition of quantum states to find the period efficiently.\n",
    "- If this step is run without a quantum computer, it would take exponential time, which is infeasible for large $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Use the period $r$ to factorize N\n",
    "- Once we compute the period $r$, we proceed as follows:\n",
    "    - If r is odd or if $a^{r/2} \\equiv 1 (\\textrm{mod} N)$, we cannot reliably factorize $N$, and we may need to try a new value of $a$.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, compute the factors of N using:\n",
    "        factors = $\\textrm{gcd}(a^{r/2} - 1, N)$ and $\\textrm{gcd}(a^{r/2} + 1, N)$\n",
    "    - One or both of these gcd calculations will yield a factor of N with high probability.\n",
    "- Mathematically, this step works because the properties of modular arithmetic link the period $r$ to the factors of $N.$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Considerations\n",
    "Why is Shor's algorithm probabilistic?\n",
    "- The success of Shor's algorithm depends on the selection of $a$. If a chosen $a$ does not provide a useful period $r$,\n",
    "  we must retry with a new value of $a$. This makes the algorithm probabilistic.\n",
    "- Additionally, quantum computers produce results probabilistically due to the nature of quantum measurements.\n",
    "  This means that we might have to run the quantum computation multiple times to increase the confidence in the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependence on quantum computers:\n",
    "- The critical Step 2 would take exponential time on a classical computer since determining the period $r$ using\n",
    "  modular exponentiation grows exponentially with the size of N.\n",
    "- Quantum computers, however, leverage superposition and interference to solve the period-finding problem efficiently,\n",
    "  making them exponentially faster than classical computers for this specific task."
